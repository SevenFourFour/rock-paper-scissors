# rock-paper-scissors

This project will be an implementation of the class game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using Javascript. 

## Version 1

This version of the project will focus on recreating the game solely through the browser's console. A future update will add a graphical user interface. 

## Version 2 

This version of the project allows the user to play the game with a barebones GUI 
created from buttons, event listeners, and dynamically created text content containers. Functionality has been implemented for the user to replay the game upon finishing.
